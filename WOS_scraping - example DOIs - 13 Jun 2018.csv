"Continuously tracking the movement of a fluid or a plume in the subsurface is a challenge that is often encountered in applications, such as tracking a plume of injected CO2 or of a hazardous substance. Advances in monitoring techniques have made it possible to collect measurements at a high frequency while the plume moves, which has the potential advantage of providing continuous high-resolution images of fluid flow with the aid of data processing. However, the applicability of this approach is limited by the high computational cost associated with having to analyze large data sets within the time constraints imposed by real-time monitoring. Existing data assimilation methods have computational requirements that increase superlinearly with the size of the unknowns m. In this paper, we present the HiKF, a new Kalman filter (KF) variant powered by the hierarchical matrix approach that dramatically reduces the computational and storage cost of the standard KF from O(m(2)) to O(m), while producing practically the same results. The version of HiKF that is presented here takes advantage of the so-called random walk dynamical model, which is tailored to a class of data assimilation problems in which measurements are collected quasi-continuously. The proposed method has been applied to a realistic CO2 injection model and compared with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Numerical results show that HiKF can provide estimates that are more accurate than EnKF and also demonstrate the usefulness of modeling the system dynamics as a random walk in this context.",A Kalman filter powered by H-2-matrices for quasi-continuous data assimilation problems,"['Li, Judith Yue', 'Ambikasaran, Sivaram', 'Darve, Eric F.', 'Kitanidis, Peter K.']",13.192982456140271,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,4,1,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,10.1002/2013WR014607,0.9122807017543859,Article,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"['GENERALIZED COVARIANCE FUNCTIONS', 'HIERARCHICAL MATRICES', 'ERROR COVARIANCE', 'INVERSE PROBLEMS', 'PART I', 'TOMOGRAPHY', 'LOCALIZATION', 'ALGORITHM', 'SOLVER', 'MODEL']",4,16,57,2014-05-01,2014,9,WOS:000337672900008
"This paper demonstrates that the nature and extent of residual CO2 trapping depend on the process by which the CO2 phase is introduced into the rock. We compare residual trapping of CO2 in Berea Sandstone by imbibing water into a core containing either exsolved CO2 or CO2 introduced by drainage. X-ray computed tomography measurements are used to map the spatial distribution of CO2 preimbibition and postimbibition. Unlike during drainage where the CO2 distribution is strongly influenced by the heterogeneity of the rock, the distribution of exsolved CO2 is comparatively uniform. Postimbibition, the CO2 distribution retained the essential features for both the exsolved and drainage cases, but twice as much residual trapping is observed for exsolved CO2 even with similar preimbibition gas saturations. Residually trapped exsolved gas also disproportionately reduced water relative permeability. Development of process-dependent parameterization will help better manage subsurface flow processes and unlock benefits from gas exsolution.",Process-dependent residual trapping of CO2 in sandstone,"['Zuo, Lin', 'Benson, Sally M.']",11.428571428571331,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2,7,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,2,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,10.1002/2014GL059653,0.9285714285714286,Article,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"['HETEROGENEOUS POROUS-MEDIA', 'PORE-NETWORK', 'CARBON SEQUESTRATION', 'MULTIPHASE FLOW', 'SALINE AQUIFERS', 'WATER', 'INJECTION', 'GAS', 'PERMEABILITY', 'DISPLACEMENT']",2,7,56,2014-04-28,2014,15,WOS:000335809800021
